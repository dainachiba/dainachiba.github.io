I am a visiting research fellow in the [Graduate School of Law](http://www.law.kobe-u.ac.jp/english.html) at [Kobe University](https://www.kobe-u.ac.jp/en/index.html). 
Prior to coming to Kobe, I was a senior lecturer (associate professor) in government at the [University of Essex](https://www.essex.ac.uk/) in the United Kingdom. 
I obtained a Ph.D in political science from [Rice University](https://rice.edu/) and completed a postdoctoral fellowship at [Duke University](https://duke.edu/) in the United States. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of data science and international politics. 
In particular, I apply quantitative methods to study why, when, and how a violent conflict arises between and within states and how political institutions influence states' conflict behaviors. 
My work has appeared in various academic journals, including <i>American Journal of Political Science</i>, <i>Political Analysis</i>, <i>Journal of Politics</i>, and <i>Journal of Conflict Resolution</i>.
