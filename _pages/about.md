I am appointed as an Associate Professor of [Political Science](https://www.um.edu.mo/fss/pa/) at the [University of Macau](https://www.um.edu.mo/) in Macao SAR of China, although the commencement is currently pending due to the pandemic. In the meantime, I work as a researcher at the [Institute of Political Economy](https://www.waseda.jp/fpse/winpec/en/) at [Waseda University](https://www.waseda.jp/) and at the [Graduate School of Law](http://www.law.kobe-u.ac.jp/english.html) at [Kobe University](https://www.kobe-u.ac.jp/en/). Previously, I was a Senior Lecturer in government at the [University of Essex](https://www.essex.ac.uk/) in the United Kingdom. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of data science and international politics.  I study conflict and cooperation among political actors using formal, statistical, and experimental methods.  My work has appeared in various academic journals, including <i>American Journal of Political Science</i>, <i>Political Analysis</i>, <i>Journal of Politics</i>, and <i>Journal of Conflict Resolution</i>.
