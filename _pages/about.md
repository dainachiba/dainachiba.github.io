I am a Senior Lecturer in the [Department of Government](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/government) at the [University of Essex](https://www.essex.ac.uk/). Before joining Essex, I obtained a Ph.D. in [Political Science](https://politicalscience.rice.edu/) from [Rice University](https://rice.edu/) (Houston, Texas) in 2012 and then worked as a Postdoctoral Associate at [Duke University](https://duke.edu/) (Durham, North Carolina) for one year. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of data science and international politics. In particular, I apply quantitative methods to study international security, political economy, and international institutions.  My work has appeared in various academic journals, including <i>American Journal of Political Science</i>, <i>Political Analysis</i>, <i>Journal of Politics</i>, and <i>Journal of Conflict Resolution</i>.
