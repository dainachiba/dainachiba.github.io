I am an associate professor of political science in the [Department of Government and Public Administration](https://gpa.fss.um.edu.mo/) at the [University of Macau](https://www.um.edu.mo/) (UM) in Macau SAR, China.  Prior to joining UM, I taught and studied political science at universities in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan.

My research interests lie at the intersection of data science, international relations, and comparative politics.  I use quantitative methods to study conflict and cooperation among political actors.  My work has been published in various peer-reviewed journals, including *American Political Science Review*, *American Journal of Political Science*, *Political Analysis*, *Journal of Politics*, and *Journal of Peace Research*.
