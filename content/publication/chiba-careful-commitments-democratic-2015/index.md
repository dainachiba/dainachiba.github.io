abstract: Evidence suggests that leaders of democratic states experience high costs
  from violating past commitments. We argue that because democratic leaders foresee
  the costs of violation, they are careful to design agreements they expect to have
  a high probability of fulfilling. This may cause democratic leaders to prefer flexible
  or limited commitments. We evaluate our argument by analyzing the design of alliance
  treaties signed by countries of the world between 1815 and 2003. We find that alliances
  formed among democratic states are more likely to include obligations for future
  consultation rather than precommitting leaders to active conflict, and defense pacts
  formed among democratic states are more likely to specify limits to the conditions
  under which member states must join their partners in conflict. This research suggests
  that separating screening effects and constraining effects of international agreements
  is even more difficult than previously believed. States with the greatest likelihood
  of being constrained are more carefully screened.
