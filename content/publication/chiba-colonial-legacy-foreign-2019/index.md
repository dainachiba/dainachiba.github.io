abstract: "It is well-known that donors give considerably more foreign aid to former\
  \ colonies than to countries lacking past colonial ties. Unfortunately, we know\
  \ relatively little about why this is the case. For one, there is almost never a\
  \ theoretical justification for the inclusion of colonial history in statistical\
  \ models. For the other, the only explicitly made rationale by Bueno de Mesquita\
  \ and Smith (2009) actually predicts an interpretational problem: colonial history\
  \ not only increases a former colony's saliency to the donor, but also has left\
  \ deep marks on recipients' social and political institutions today. Both aspects\
  \ shape how much aid a donor transfers to the recipient. This leaves ambiguous the\
  \ meaning of the routinely found positive, sizable, and significant coefficient\
  \ of colonial history on aid flows. We solve the inferential quandary by using a\
  \ decomposition approach from labor econometrics. Our results show that about 75â€“\
  \ 100% of the colony effect on foreign aid stems from the greater saliency that\
  \ donors give to policy concessions from former colonies."
