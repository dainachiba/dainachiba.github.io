abstract: Theories of coalition politics in parliamentary democracies have suggested
  that government formation and survival are jointly determined outcomes. An important
  empirical implication of these theories is that the sample of observed governments
  analyzed in studies of government survival may be nonrandomly selected from the
  population of potential governments. This can lead to serious inferential problems.
  Unfortunately, current empirical models of government survival are unable to account
  for the possible biases arising from nonrandom selection. In this study, we use
  a copula-based framework to assess, and correct for, the dependence between the
  processes of government formation and survival. Our results suggest that existing
  studies of government survival, by ignoring the selection problem, overstate the
  substantive importance of several covariates commonly included in empirical models.
