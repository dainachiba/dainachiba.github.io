abstract: Can international organizations constrain a leader's behavior during a military
  crisis? Existing studies have shown that joint membership in international organizations
  reduces the likelihood of dispute initiation; however, whether institutional opposition
  can prevent an ongoing conflict from escalating has yet to be investigated. We develop
  and test a theory of how domestic politics provides a mechanism through which international
  organizations can reverse the course of a military crisis. The argument leads to
  the hypothesis that more accountable regimes are less likely to escalate military
  crises when an international organization opposes their actions. We test the hypothesis
  with an analysis of territorial disputes from 1946 to 1995. We find that while neither
  institutional opposition nor the degree of regime accountability independently reduces
  the tendency for a country to escalate a conflict, the joint effect of the two does.
