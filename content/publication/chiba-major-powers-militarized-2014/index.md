abstract: This article attempts to answer the question of why major powers engage
  in more active foreign policy behaviors than minor powers. It does so by comparing
  two explanations for the increased conflict propensity of major powers. The first
  explanation focuses on major powers' observable capabilities, while the second stresses
  their different behavior. We incorporate both into an ultimatum model of conflict
  in which a state's cost of conflict consists of both observable and behavioral components.
  Using data from the period from 1870 to 2001, we empirically illustrate the observable
  and behavioral differences between major and minor powers. We then utilize a decomposition
  model to assess the relative significance of the two explanations. The results suggest
  that most of the difference in conflict propensity between major and minor powers
  can be attributed to observable differences.
