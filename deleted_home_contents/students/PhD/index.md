If you are interested in working with me for your Ph.D, please feel free to get in touch via email. Before doing so, however, please read the following.

Consult UM's [Ph.D programmes page](https://grs.um.edu.mo/index.php/prospective-students/doctoral-degrees-programmes/) for information about admission requirements. Although Ph.D applications can be submitted throughout the year (Aug - Oct for 1st batch, Nov - Mar for 2nd batch, and May - Jul for 3rd batch), I strongly encourage you to aim for the 1st batch deadline especially if you wish to obtain UM PhD scholarship.

Please note that I cannot answer any question regarding your application status or application procedure.
