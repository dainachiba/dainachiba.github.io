	abstract = {This paper investigates the dynamics of legislative politics within the unique political context of the Macau Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China. Drawing on recently collected data from roll-call votes and committee deliberations taken during the fifth and sixth legislative assemblies, this study shifts the focus from electoral processes and resolution proposals to an analysis of bill proposals with the potential to become law. The findings reveal a structural dichotomy between a large, cohesive pro-establishment faction and a smaller, more fragmented opposition, which contrasts with the findings of previous research that suggest a more balanced opposition. Further analysis of committee deliberations indicates that this stable dichotomy allows regime loyalists to voice dissent without appearing rebellious, enabling ruling elites to gauge and respond to constituents’ preferences on non-sensitive issues. This dynamic highlights the distinct legislative practices of Macau SAR under the “one country, two systems” framework., 摘要本文聚焦中国澳门特别行政区特有政治背景下的立法动态。通过系统收集并分析第五届和第六届立法会的点名表决与委员会审议数据,本研究将关注点从选举过程与决议提案转向对法律草案的深入分析。研究发现,立法会内部呈现结构性二元分化:一方是规模较大且团结的建制阵营,另一方则是规模较小且碎片化的反对力量。这一发现修正了既往研究中关于双方势力相对均衡的观点。对委员会审议数据的进一步分析表明,这种稳定的二元结构使建制派成员得以在维持整体和谐的前提下表达政策异议,从而使执政精英能够就非敏感性议题有效吸纳并回应选民偏好。这一动态揭示了澳门特别行政区在“一国两制”框架下独特的立法实践特征。},
